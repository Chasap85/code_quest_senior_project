# CodeQuest

CodeQuest is an experience that aims to revolutionize coding education for students aged
9-13 by immersing them in interactive stories where they write real Python code to
guide quirky characters through challenges, fostering engagement, creativity, and
practical coding skills.

### **About our repo**
* **Addons**: Third party plugins supported by Godot that were put to use in this project.
* **Assets**: Assets that are used throughout CodeQuest. Including but not limited to things such as dialogue files, fonts, UI image elements, and level data.
* **Audio**: Audio files for sounds used in game and supporting audio bus files.
* **Components**: Godot Text Scene (TSCN) files that make up the scene trees for components as well as animations. These are used in level scenes and can be reused.
* **Graphics**: Images that are used to make up visuals related to gameplay such as characters and backgrounds, seperate from UI elements stored in **Assets**
* **Level-Scenes**: TSCN files used to makeup the playable levels themselves. Parent scenes that utilize components and animations to tie everything together.
* **Scripts**: Scripts tied to each TSCN file to add functionality through GDScript.
