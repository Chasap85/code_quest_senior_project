## Vision Statement
In CodeQuest, young heroes write real Python code to guide quirky creatures through interactive stories, unlocking magical worlds and becoming coding superstars.

## Gameplay Synopsis

### Game Model
The game follows a linear progression model, meaning all users advance through levels in the same order and encounter the same experiences. Users initiate the game by selecting a level or topic for learning, with subsequent levels remaining locked until the prior one is completed.

### In-Game
Once the user selects a level, the game presents educational material through text and visuals. Users are then prompted to reinforce their understanding by writing code to complete tasks, an example being writing a for-loop with if-else logic.

### Uniqueness
Instead of block-based logic, this game dives straight into writing real code, the kind you'd encounter in real-world applications. Furthermore, it distinguishes itself from other coding games by emphasizing real logic rather than basic movement commands, challenging users to unravel complex coding concepts rather than simply executing predetermined actions.

## Mechanics

### Introduction
Each level presents a story tailored to younger audiences that introduces a problem and a tutorial for the concept being learned. This builds context and motivates players to engage.

### Challenge Presentation
The specific challenge is laid out, clearly stating the objective and providing visual cues or hints.

### Coding Interface
A simplified IDE, designed for a younger audience, allows players to write Python code line by line. Visual cues can aid understanding of syntax and structure.

### Real-Time Execution
As players write and run their code, they can immediately see the results within the story context. Animations and visuals bring their code to life and showcase the impact of their decisions.

### Iterative Problem-Solving
Players experiment with different code variations, testing their logic and adapting based on the results. Hints and guidance can be offered if needed, but the emphasis is on self-discovery and learning through trial and error.

## Setting
The game setting will change based on level. One level might be based in the wild west, another level may be in space.

## Gameplay

### Overview
Gameplay in CodeQuest mimics LeetCode. In other words, the user is given a prompt and using their knowledge, they write code to satisfy the requirements.

### Gameplay Description
After the user is instructed on the material, players in CodeQuest encounter a split-screen layout. On the left, animations, visuals, or gameplay unfold, while the right side presents the coding interface and the current prompt. 

### Winning Condition
The user must write code that satisfies the prompt requirement.

### Modes
The initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of CodeQuest will not feature a separate mode. If time permits, a challenge mode could be added, potentially offering tougher prompts and/or fewer hints.

## Levels
Each level in CodeQuest is thoroughly designed, typically comprising three main components: the lesson plan (educational content), a storyline (guides animations), and interactive elements (animation, coding tasks).

## Flowchart
In-Game Menu and Winning Screen (Dark Teal) are elements reused on each level.

## Game Characters
Each level in CodeQuest is different, which leads to characters that are unique to each level.

## PC
There are no planned player characters at this time.

## NPC
There will be at least one NPC for every level that is relevant to the story. Names and characteristics for these NPCs will be developed during the level's development process.

## NPC Behavior
The NPC may exclaim statements relevant to the story or hint at a solution through a chat bubble or similar.

## Story
CodeQuest features diverse stories instead of one.

### Narrative Device
The story will utilize chronological and real-time narrative devices.

## The Game World
In CodeQuest, there's no fixed game world; each level offers a unique environment crafted to enhance the lesson plan.

## Media List

### Art Direction
Color levels should be vibrant with coding related motifs that are engaging for kids 9 - 13.
